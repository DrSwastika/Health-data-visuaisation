# Health-data-visuaisation
**Project Report:**

This study employs ggplot, a powerful data visualization tool, to explore and illustrate key findings regarding the relationship between lifestyle factors and obesity prevalence across diverse demographic cohorts. By exploring the relationships between variables such as physical activity levels, dietary habits, and substance use with varying levels of obesity, I aim to uncover insights into the multifaceted nature of this health issue.
The data-set consists of information from 2111 individuals across 3 different countries. It includes information related to individualsâ€™ attributes and lifestyle choices, such as gender, age, height, weight, family history of overweight, dietary habits, physical activity level, habits, water intake, monitoring of calorie intake, time spent using technological devices, mode of transportation, and obesity level. Our ggplot visualizations provide insightful representations of complex data patterns, aiding in the interpretation and communication of our research findings.

**Result summary:**

The analysis of lifestyle factors and obesity prevalence revealed several noteworthy patterns. Firstly, a majority of individuals, particularly those with obesity, do not monitor their calorie intake, highlighting a potential area for intervention in weight management strategies. High-calorie food consumption was prevalent among individuals with obesity, with a significant proportion admitting to consuming such foods regularly. Additionally, while vegetables were included in meals by a majority across all weight categories, their consistent inclusion was notably higher among those with obesity. The data also indicated differences in meal frequency and snacking habits among weight categories, with a higher proportion of individuals with obesity reporting frequent snacking between meals. Regarding water intake, most individuals consumed 1-2 liters daily, with a notable percentage of those with obesity drinking more than 2 liters. 

Alcohol consumption patterns revealed interesting trends, with a majority indulging occasionally, but notably higher alcohol abstinence among those with low or normal weight. Smoking habits were rare across all weight categories, with a slightly higher prevalence among individuals with low or normal weight. Analysis across different age groups indicated varying patterns of obesity prevalence, with distinct trends emerging in each age bracket. Finally, the distribution of physical activity frequency highlighted differences across weight categories, with individuals with insufficient weight exhibiting a slightly higher frequency of physical activity compared to other categories. These findings underscore the multifaceted nature of obesity and the importance of considering diverse lifestyle factors in understanding its prevalence and management strategies.

In summary, these visualizations collectively contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between lifestyle factors, demographic characteristics, and obesity prevalence. They underscore the importance of adopting healthy behaviors, such as regular physical activity and nutritious dietary habits, in preventing and managing obesity.
